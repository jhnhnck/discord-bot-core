## openBot ##
openBot is an open sourced project headed by me **[Stephen DuVall](https://github.com/stphnduvall)** and **[John Hancock.](https://github.com/jhnhnck)**

Our goal is to create a simple, easily expandable, and well documented framework to add custom commands and interactions to [Discord](https://discordapp.com).
